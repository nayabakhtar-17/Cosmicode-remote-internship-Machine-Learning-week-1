# 🚀 CosmiCode ML Internship – Week 1

Welcome to my Week 1 project from the Machine Learning Internship at CosmiCode 
This notebook covers essential foundational tasks for beginners in Machine Learning, built using real-world data and practical tools.


## 🔧 Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Linear Regression from Scratch
- Implemented using only NumPy
- Visualized regression line over data

### 🔹 Task 2: Data Cleaning
- Used the Seaborn tips dataset
- Handled missing values, outliers (Z-score), and scaling (StandardScaler)

### 🔹 Task 3: Feature Selection
- Analyzed correlations
- Applied Mutual Information to rank features

### 🔹 Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms, box plots, and pair plots for in-depth understanding

### 🔹 Task 5: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduced dimensionality to 2D
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots
